## Project 4 for CSCI 130

This program calculates the cost of throwing a childâ€™s birthday party as determined by the age of the birthday child and the number of guests invited, plus the cost of the birthday cake. It then outputs the report, breaking down the number of each item to purchase and the cost of each item, as well as the total cost, to a file name determined by the user.
